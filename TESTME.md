## RESPONSIVENESS TESTING

<details>
<summary>üëá</summary>

The deployed project was tested on multiple devices for responsiveness issues.

![Responsiveness](docs/amires.JPG)

You will observe the tag line under the logo is expanded as screen size increases, & the navbar on mobile is a cut down version of navbar on full screen. The following Bootstrap classes `table-responsive table-condensed nav-expand d-none d-*-block` aid responsiviness & avoid need for media queries. However I have encountered a problem with table alignment which will not be sorted before submitting [link to table on Full Task List on > small screens]() 
It would be better UX if I could have implemented a sticky-navbar.

## BROWSER COMPABILITY TESTING


<details>
<summary>üëá</summary>

The deployed project was tested on 3 browsers to check for compatibility issues and works as expected.

## CODE VALIDATION

<details>
<summary>üëá</summary>

### HTML

[HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) Screenshots

| Sign  Out | ![HTML Validation - Signout](docs/v-signout.jpg)  |
| Todo |  ![HTML Validation - Todo](docs/v-todo.jpg) | Yes there is a problem here as strictly speaking one should not have a button inside an anchor tag, This button is the Delete Task action.  The original plan was to use a modal when the user requested to delete a Task, but unfortunatley I could not get the Task ID data to the modal, I then had to revert to some sort of basic warning to the user so that where I started to use the tooltip to pop up a message to the user that this action cannot be undone & afaik to get the tooltip working I neede to use the button element.|

## USER STORY TESTING

<details>
<summary>üëá</summary>

I found that user stories (US) are a work in progress during the development of the project, I feel in a better position now that I am nearer the end of the project in defining US that I was at the start as having come through that process I now have a better understanding of them with clearly more to learn.  Armed with this knwoeldge I re define the US's here to aid in documenting US testing, Hence these will not follow the same USs as is in the  `@siobhain's CTB project`  [here](https://github.com/users/siobhain/projects/9) & deadline will not allow me to redo (regenerate) the US's on Github Project.
