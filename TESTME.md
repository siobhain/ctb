## RESPONSIVENESS TESTING

<details>
<summary>üëá</summary>

The deployed project was tested on multiple devices for responsiveness issues.

![Responsiveness](docs/amires.JPG)

You will observe the tag line under the logo is expanded as screen size increases, & the navbar on mobile is a cut down version of navbar on full screen. The following Bootstrap classes `table-responsive table-condensed nav-expand sticky-top (if I can get it working) d-none d-*-block` aid responsiviness & avoid need for media queries. However I have encountered a problem with table alignment which I hope can be sorted before submitting [link to table on Full Task List on > small screens]()
