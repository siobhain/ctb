<h1> Community Task Board </h1>

Ireland’s community, voluntary and charity sector makes a very substantial contribution to society in general. There are almost 10,000 registered charities and a further 20,000+ organisations in Ireland’s wider nonprofit sector.

This is a simple tool that can be used by groups in the CVC sector to aid in management and administration of tasks assigned to members of the group.

  ### About

This is a simple tool that can be used by groups in the CVC sector to aid in management and administration of tasks assigned to members of the group.

## User Experience Design (UXD)

As much as practical I followed the User Centered Design (UCD) process to ensure this app is intuitive and easy to use.

### User Goals

- Be able to enter a task
- Be able to change status on their task 
- View the groups list of tasks

### Site Owner Goals

- Provide an online solution for community groups to view list of tasks whether already done or to be completed
- Create a visually appealing site
- Provide a fully responsive application with straightforward navigation




### Target Audience
- Community groups who want to be more organised with their tasks
- Community groups who want to keep non members informed of work being done by the group
- An online log of all tasks 

### User Requirements and Expectations

- Straightforward navigation
- Easy to use
- A responsive application that allows the user to create a task on any device
- Visually appealing design for any screen size
- Links and functions that work as expected

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.
